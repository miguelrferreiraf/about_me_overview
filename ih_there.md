My name is Miguel Ferreira and I am a **machine learning engineer** and **data scientist**.

Really really love what I do 😀! ***I'm obsessed*** with the implications of generative machine <br>
learning and how it can change how we face real world problems. But not only this: I wonder <br>
not only what machine learning can do for ourselves but what WE may learn from them 😦 :suspect:.

I have familiarity with most of Python technologies of machine learning and data science but <br>
my most important tool is my capabilitie to link different fields of knowledge in a engaging <br>
algorithm. My interests include:

- Machine learning, IA and it's implications
- Mathematics for machine learning and data science
- Philosophy, history and why world is what it is
- Chess (not specially well played), swimming 🏊‍♂️
- Nature and how it define us at all 🌎☀️🌊🐦
