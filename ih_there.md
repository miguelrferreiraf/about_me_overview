My name is Miguel Ferreira and I am a **machine learning engineer** and **data scientist**.

Really really love what I do 😀! ***I'm obsessed*** with the implications of generative machine <br>
learning and how it can change how we face real world problems. But not only this: I wonder <br>
not only what machine learning can do for ourselves but what WE may learn from them 😦:suspect:.

I have familiarity with most of **Python technologies** of **machine learning and data science** <br>
but my most important tool is my capabilitie to link different fields of knowledge in a engaging <br>
algorithm. My interests include:

- 📊 Machine learning, IA and it's implications 📉
- ➗ Mathematics for machine learning and data science
- 📚 Philosophy, history and why world is what it is 📖
- 🏊‍ Swimming, chess (not specifically wel played 😆)
- 🌎 Nature and how it define us at all ☀️🌊

I'm obsessed with nature. That's why I chose _The wanderer above the sea of fog_ to open my overview.<br>
It's the opitome of the romantic nature affected man. With romantic I mean not traditionally <br>
romantic, like Titanic or Romeu and Juliet, but romantic by thinking over our place in world. I <br>
constantly think about while programming, how technology inspire me to the other hand: life, nature, <br>
culture... things like this really move me and soar me.
