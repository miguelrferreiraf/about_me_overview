My name is Miguel Ferreira and I am a machine learning engineer and data scientist.

Really really love what I do 😀! I'm obsessed with the implications of generative mashine learning and how it can change how we face real world problemas. But not only this: I wonder not only what machine learning can do for ourselves but what WE may learn freom them 😦 :suspect:.

I have familiarity with most of Python technologies of machine learning and data science but my most important tool is my capabilitie to link different fields of knowledge in engaging algorithm. My interest include:

- Machine learning, IA and it's implications
- Mathematics for machine learning and data science
- Philosophy, history and why world is what it is
- Chess 
- Nature and how it define us at all ☀️🌊🐦

## Nature affects me.
