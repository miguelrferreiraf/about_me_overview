# Hello there! 😊

My name is Miguel Ferreira and I am a **machine learning engineer** and **data scientist**.

Really really love what I do 😀! ***I'm obsessed*** with the implications of generative machine <br>
learning and how it can change how we face real world problems. But not only this: I wonder <br>
not only what machine learning can do for ourselves but what WE may learn from them 😦 :suspect:.

I have familiarity with most of Python technologies of machine learning and data science but <br>
my most important tool is my capabilitie to link different fields of knowledge in a engaging <br>
algorithm. My interests include:

- Machine learning, IA and it's implications
- Mathematics for machine learning and data science
- Philosophy, history and why world is what it is
- Chess (not specially well played), swimming 🏊‍♂️
- Nature and how it define us at all 🌎☀️🌊🐦

- **Nature affects me** 🌳🌋.

  I'm obsessed with nature. That's why I chose _The wanderer above the sea of fog_ to open my overview.<br>
  It's the opitome of the romantic nature affected man. With romantic I mean not traditionally <br>
  romantic, like Titanic or Romeu and Juliet, but romantic by thinking over our place in world. I <br>
  constantly think about while programming, how technology inspire me to the other hand: life, nature, <br>
  culture... things like this really move me and soar me.
